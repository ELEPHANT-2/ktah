**K'tah!** is a browser based, cooperative, class-oriented zombie survival game designed for true 
team play. Players not only work in synergy with, but also depend upon, one another in order 
to reach the highest levels of achievement. Unlike most titles in the genre, K'tah!'s gameplay 
requires players to route, outrun, and outsmart the zombie horde, rather than follow the usual
hack, slash, and obliterate paradigm. Player accounts undergo progressive development, enriching 
class-play with added abilities and features. Few can survive the challenge of K'tah!; are you 
amongst them?

This project was developed as part of the LMU course CMSI 401. See the

K'tah is in no way, shape, or form associated with katah (Գաթա). Please do not mistake this game for 
the Armenian bread.
