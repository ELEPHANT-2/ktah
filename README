K'tah! is a browser based, coop, class oriented zombie survival game designed for true team oriented play. 
Classes not only work in synergy with, but also depend upon, one another in order to reach the highest 
levels of achievement. Unlike most titles in the genre, K'tah!'s gameplay requires players to route, 
outrun, and outsmart the zombie horde, rather than follow the usual hack, slash, and obliterate paradigm. 
Player accounts undergo progressive development, enriching class-play with added abilities and features. 
Few can survive the challenge of K'tah!; are you amongst them?

K'tah is in no way, shape or form associated with katah (Գաթա). Please do not mistake this game for 
the Armenian bread.
