 * The type of "tinker" containing class attributes.
 *
 * The tinker "excels" in a variety of abilities that may greatly
 * aid or hinder his team and their abilities. Aside from most of 
 * his abilities relying on a toss of the dice, he is the only class
 * capable of consistently chipping away at members of the horde,
 * able to disable the occasional member for an entire round.
