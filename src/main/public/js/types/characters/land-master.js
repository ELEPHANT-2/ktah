 *
 * The type of "land master" containing class attributes.
 *
 * Acting in synergy with her environment, the land master's
 * abilities rely heavily on her adjacent resources and terrain.
 * By consuming resources in such a manner, her abilities tend 
 * to be more powerful, but at the cost of convenience (requiring 
 * proximity to certain features).
